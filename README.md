## Decisions made while building this app

First I made react app with npx create react app because dependencies
can be easy installed on another PC.
After that I have created component folder where I've stashed my components and images.
The first thing I did was HTTP request to the Marvel API so I can fetch the data.
I have decided to use AXIOS for this project because it has built in error handiling. I use it with newest standard async/await.
I was thinking if I should filter data directly after response but I decided to put it in array
because I thought that it would be easy to manage state like that and for me it was.
Now I needed to filter data while typing in the input so I did, but I made a mistake and I have putted it in the same effect as request and there was a delay after typing so I made another effect for the filter so that is how I fixed it. After that I needed component for all that data with bookmark icon and everything else that you can see in that component.
The one more dilemma I had was if I should use modules.css or just .css but I decided to go with .css because this is not a big project but If it was I would definitely go with modules

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
